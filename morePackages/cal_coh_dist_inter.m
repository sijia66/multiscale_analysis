function P_chamber_coh = cal_coh_dist_inter(P_chamber_temp1,P_chamber_temp2,cohSeq_firstFrame,distThres)
%cal_coh_dist calculates the average coherence given a distance threshold
%   The coherence between two drives within the distance
%  is averaged
%   Input
%       P_chamber_temp1 is a nE by 2 matrix of positions for first drive
%       P_chamber_temp2 is a nE by 2 matrix of positions for second drive
%       cohSeq_firstFrame is a nE by nE coherence matrix
%       distThres is the distance threshold
%   Output
%       P_chamber_coh is a nE by 3 matrix of the positions and the average
%       coherence
%   
%   Under construction:
%       need to do error checking
