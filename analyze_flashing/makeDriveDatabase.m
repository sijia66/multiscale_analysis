%This function looks through all day directories within date_range (or all in the directory if date-range not specified)
%and makes a 'Drive Database'. The database is a Sessions cell with the day and recordings where the specified drive was recorded
%Note that this searches by 'name_base' and not for a specific drive.
%
%input: drive_base  - string, name_base of drive to find.
%       date_range - cell of strings, {'YYMMDD', 'YYMMDD'} specifying the start and end date ranges to include. 
%                    To include all days, either set to 'all' or {}. If not specified, defaults to 'all'.
%       monkeydir  - string w/ project directory. If not input or empty, uses the global MONKEYDIR
%     
%output: Session - session cell w/ session info for a given drive
%                  Cell format for each session:
%                  {DAY, {recs}, DRIVE_NAME, DRIVE_BASE, IMPLANT_DATE, DRIVE_ID, DRIVE_THETA, DRIVE_X, DRIVE_Y, SESS_#}
%                  A session is created for each unique drive (i.e. drive name is different, but same drive base) and for each day.
